          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>Computers, cricket and music lover, with a deep passion for coding.<br>
             A learning website developer with a bit of app developing knowledge<br>
             and a fitness freak with curiosity for art and fondness for poetry</p>

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>What began as a love to create games has now shifted to designing and developing websites. I have been practicing website making for a few months now and would like to call myself intermediate in web development. I am motivated to learn more as time passes!</p>

            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Clicking and capturing the moment, it has forever interested me. Analyzing the angles and exploring the depths and everything else attributed to it, gravitates me towards photography. </p>

            <h3 id="writing-h">Writing</h3>
            <p id="writing-p">I've always had keen interest in writing and peculiarly, poetry, lately. Penning down the thoughts, taking the mind through wild journeys, it surely makes poetry among the best forms of expressions, except coding perhaps : )</p>
